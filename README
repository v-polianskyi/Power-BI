# Power-BI
This repository contains a Power BI project working on sales data from a fictional hardware company AltiQ. 

It is a consumer goods electronics company having operations in various countries. 
Their business is growing rapidly and they still rely on Excel files for data analytics. 

Due to the lack of effective analytics, the company faced a major loss in Latin America.

I, as a part of the data analytics team, am tasked to build appropriate dashboards and finance reports 
to shed some light on AltiQ's Financial, Logistical, and Marketing well-being.
